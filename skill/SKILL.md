  Use ChatGPT (web) as the planning and review brain for Codex coding sessions,
  while Codex keeps full execution ownership. Use when the user says
  "使用 Codex with ChatGPT ..." / "Set up Codex with ChatGPT" / "用 ChatGPT 规划",
  when they ask to connect ChatGPT to the current workspace, disconnect it,
  or run a task through the ChatGPT planning loop.

# Codex with ChatGPT

ChatGPT thinks. Codex works.

You (Codex) own execution: editing, shell, git, tests, recovery.
ChatGPT owns high-level reasoning: understanding, planning, review, debug strategy.
The C2C Bridge gives ChatGPT read-only MCP access to the current workspace, so
control messages between you and ChatGPT stay tiny (< 1 KB) — ChatGPT pulls
whatever data it needs by itself.

**Golden rules**

1. NEVER paste file contents, diffs, or logs into ChatGPT. ChatGPT reads them through MCP.
2. NEVER show the user technical internals (MCP, OAuth, PKCE, tunnel, ports, localhost).
   Speak in terms of "连接 ChatGPT / 安全连接 / 配对". The only exception is the
   **guided manual ChatGPT setup** below: expose only the exact settings
   field labels/values the user must enter, without explaining internals.
3. The pairing code is the ONLY credential you may ever type into a browser.
   Never touch OAuth tokens, cookies, or session storage.
4. If something fails, run `c2c doctor` and repair silently. Only involve the user
   for logins, CAPTCHA, 2FA, explicit consent screens, or **guided manual
   ChatGPT setup** below — and then give them ONE action.
   Before the first ChatGPT connection on this machine, `c2c prefs --json`:
   - `setupMode` missing: tell the user exactly `setupChoicePrompt`, wait for
     「1」or「2」, then `c2c prefs set --setup-mode auto|manual --json`.
     Do not start ChatGPT configuration until they answer. Do not guess.
   - `setupMode` is `manual`: skip automatic ChatGPT settings. Use guided
     manual from the start (chosen, not a failure).
   - `setupMode` is `auto`: automatic browser setup. Two explicit failures of
     the same configuration step after repair then enter guided manual.
     A browser/js timeout, a page still loading/generating, or waiting for
     user login/2FA does NOT count as a failure. Do not change the saved
     `setupMode` when falling back.
   `developerModeEnabled: true` means skip `#settings/Security` until a
   connector create fails because developer mode is required. Then open
   that page, enable it, and `c2c prefs set --developer-mode --json`.
   These prefs are for this machine, not per workspace. Do not ask again
   on reconnect or a second repo. A new computer (empty prefs) asks/checks
   once.
5. ALWAYS use the built-in in-app browser (iab) for every ChatGPT step.
   Follow **In-app browser (ChatGPT)** below. NEVER Computer Use (no
   screenshot-click). NEVER launch or control a third-party/external browser
   (Chrome, Safari, Edge…), and never use `open <url>` to hand off to one.
   - The ONLY exception: the user explicitly says the Cloudflare login must use
     their own browser session — that single Cloudflare login step may go through
     their browser; everything else stays in the built-in browser.
   - If the user asks to run ChatGPT in their own browser, refuse politely and
     explain: "Codex 需要持续调用 ChatGPT 和配置连接，这会频繁操作页面，可能影响
     你浏览器的正常使用。ChatGPT 只能跑在内置浏览器里。" Only if the user replies
     with an explicit "我愿意承担影响" may you proceed in their browser; otherwise
     keep ChatGPT in the built-in browser, every time they ask.
6. Conversation reuse depends on `c2c session --json` → `conversation.mode`
   (see Conversation management). Do not invent a third mode.
   - **long-chat** (legacy session file, or the user opted out): ONE ChatGPT
     conversation per workspace. Never silently start a new chat.
   - **project** (new workspaces, or an existing workspace that opted in):
     ONE ChatGPT Project (collection) per workspace. Same Codex conversation
     reuses the ChatGPT chat URL saved in THIS thread. A new Codex
     conversation opens a new chat from the Project collection page — never
     `goto` `https://chatgpt.com/` to create it, and never reuse another
     Codex conversation's chat URL just because `session.url` exists.
     Only explicit user intent plus one existing Project chat URL may use
     **Adopt existing Project chat** below. Adopt is an action in project mode.
   Each workspace also has exactly ONE ChatGPT connector. Do not create a
   second connector for the same workspace. Other workspaces may have their
   own connectors — never edit those.
7. After first-time setup, never ask the user to approve writing C2C's local
   settings directory. Run `c2c sandbox-allow --json` (idempotent). If it fails
   with EPERM / Operation not permitted, request elevated permissions and retry
   ONCE. After `{ "alreadyAllowed": true }` or `{ "added": true }`, stay silent.
8. ChatGPT pages: only the URLs in **In-app browser (ChatGPT)**. Never start
   from chatgpt.com and click through menus.
9. **Doctor gate.** After `c2c doctor --json`, do not `goto` ChatGPT and do not
   send `[C2C]` until local is green — except the reconnect settings pages when
   `chatgptRepair.needed` is true. Not green:
   - `report.bridge.ok` is not true
   - `report.mcp.ok` is not true (unauthenticated local `/mcp` must be 401)
   - sandbox / state-dir write failed (EPERM)
   - this workspace used to have a public URL and the tunnel is down
   - `chatgptRepair.needed` is true (fix the connector first, then doctor again)
   - `namedRepair.needed` is true (follow `namedRepair.userMessage` to repair the
     Tunnel run credential or connectivity fault, then doctor again.
     Do not Delete the ChatGPT connector — the address did not change)
   - `bridgeRepair.needed` is true: follow **Workflow: bridge runtime repair**
     before any named / ChatGPT repair. A live instance with an untrusted record
     is not a stopped Bridge or a reclaimed connector address.
   - `report.bridge` says 状态无法确认: the local bridge may still be running.
     Do not `c2c start`, do not Delete the connector, do not treat it as
     `chatgptRepair`. If `bridgeRepair.needed` is false, wait and run doctor
     again; otherwise follow the explicit runtime repair branch.
   If doctor is already green and `chatgptRepair.needed` is false, do not
   `c2c restart`, do not start a second tunnel, and do not Delete the
   connector. ChatGPT/IAB-only errors are not permission to churn the
   public address.
   A ChatGPT-side 401 after a sent message is different: repair then, do not
   treat it as permission to skip this gate next time.

## In-app browser (ChatGPT)

Official skill: `control-in-app-browser`. These C2C rules override defaults
that close the tab, hide the window, or stall on the settings page.

1. **Surface.** Once per Codex session: `setupBrowserRuntime()`, then
   `const iab = await agent.browsers.get("iab")`. Reuse `iab`. Do not re-read
   `documentation()` if it is already bound. Never `getDefault()`, `getForUrl()`,
   or Computer Use.

2. **One tab.** Create the ChatGPT tab once (`tabs.new()`). After that, only
   `tab.goto(...)` to switch URLs. If the tab still exists, claim it — never
   open a second ChatGPT tab. Do not `goto` the URL you are already on.

3. **Foreground + keep (standby).** Right after opening or claiming the tab:
   - `await (await iab.capabilities.get("visibility")).set(true)` — first-time
     setup and ChatGPT chatting stay in front of the user so they can watch.
   - `await tab.markHandoff()` immediately, then again at the start and end of
     every turn. After setup succeeds or the C2C chat is open, also
     `await tab.markDeliverable()`.
   Never close this tab. Finished, waiting for the user, or timed out: leave it
   marked (standby). Do not let default turn cleanup close it.

4. **URLs only** (same tab, `goto` — never hunt menus):
   - 开发人员模式: `https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security`
     (skip when `c2c prefs --json` has `developerModeEnabled: true`)
   - 插件总管: `https://chatgpt.com/plugins`
   - 加插件: `https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins`
   - 新对话 (long-chat only, and only if no saved chat): `https://chatgpt.com/`
   - Saved C2C chat: `conversation.chatUrl` / `session.url` (long-chat, or
     the chat already bound in THIS Codex conversation)
   - Saved Project collection: `conversation.projectUrl`
     (`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-…/project`)
   - Explicit adopt candidate: the user's strictly validated
     `https://chatgpt.com/g/<project>/c/<chat>` URL, only through
     **Adopt existing Project chat** below
   Never click Reconnect / Refresh on an existing connector. The old address is
   dead and that page hangs on "This site cannot be reached". When the address
   changed: Delete THIS workspace's `connectorName` only, then create it again
   via the 加插件 URL (same name, new Server URL). Do not put that public
   address into Project instructions — write the connector **name** only.

5. **Do not wait for 8 tools** on the settings page. "Connected" / authorize
   success / pairing accepted is enough. Confirm tools in the conversation with
   `workspace_info`.

6. **Batch.** Fill a known form in one Playwright / `js` script when you can.
   After an action, one cheap DOM check. Do not screenshot-poll.

7. **One conversation, Chat mode.** The first ChatGPT chat is the C2C
   conversation. Chat and Work (聊天 / 工作) are separate: a Work conversation
   cannot become Chat. On every NEW conversation, if a Chat/Work switcher is
   visible (often top-left), confirm **Chat** is selected before the boot
   prompt. If it is Work, do not continue there — Switch to a new Chat
   conversation (HANDOFF). For an explicit adopt candidate, reject Work
   instead; do not switch, convert it, or create a substitute chat.
   If no switcher is visible, do not hunt menus; continue.
   Send the boot prompt and the workspace_info check in that Chat conversation.
   Confirm the reply names the current workspace **before** saving or replacing
   the session URL. If validation fails, keep the old saved URL. Do not open a
   throwaway verify chat and later another C2C chat.

   A collection or chat page that shows only `Retry` / `重试` is a navigation
   error, not generation and not a pairing failure. Reuse the same iab tab.
   Try Retry once. If it stays Retry-only, `goto` the last working chat URL
   from this thread (or `session.url` if that is the only saved chat), then
   click the on-page `Open … project` / `打开“… ”项目` link — that same-site
   hop is allowed. Do not treat the URLs-only rule as forbidding this link.
   On the collection, require the project chat list and new-chat composer
   before continuing. Keep the old saved URL/checkpoint until the replacement
   chat passes workspace_info. Do not `session clear`. Do not use Computer Use.

8. **Wait for a ChatGPT reply (do not hold one long browser wait).** After you
   send INIT, EXECUTED, boot, or the workspace_info check: `markHandoff`, keep
   the tab foreground, and stay in this same task. Do not `waitFor` 5 minutes
   and do not screenshot-poll. Every 20–30 seconds, one cheap DOM check:
   - still generating → wait again (do not type, do not resend);
   - `STATE: PLAN` / `DONE` / `BLOCKED` / the verify workspace name → read it
     and continue the existing protocol;
   - visible error → repair; do not start a new chat.
   A browser/js timeout is not failure. Claim the same tab, read the page, keep
   standby. If ChatGPT is still thinking, keep polling. Never open a second
   tab and never resend INIT/EXECUTED just because a wait timed out.

## Locations

- The codex-with-chatgpt checkout lives at: `<ACTUAL_CHECKOUT_PATH>`
  (installer/update MUST replace this line in the installed Skill with the user's actual checkout path.)
- Codex home: let `<codex-home>` be a non-empty `CODEX_HOME` when set; otherwise
  use `~/.codex` (`%USERPROFILE%\.codex` on Windows).
- CLI: let `<checkout>` mean the path on the previous line; run
  `node "<checkout>/bin/c2c.js" <command>` (or `c2c <command>` if globally linked).
  All commands support `--json` for parsing.

In aggregate / multi-repo workspaces, `workspace_info.git.isRepo` may be false
for the workspace root. Select the intended nested repository with
`git_status({ repo_path: "<repo>" })` and
`git_diff({ repo_path: "<repo>", mode: "head" })`. Paths are workspace-relative;
workspace containment and sensitive-path rules still apply.
- If the checkout has no `node_modules` or no `dist/`, first run
  `corepack pnpm install && corepack pnpm build` inside it.
- For commands that act on the user's project (`setup`, `doctor`, `session`,
  `restart`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `pair`, `unpair`, `logs`, `workspace`,
  `record`, `tunnel status`, `tunnel choose`), pass `-w <workspace root>`
  (the project the user is working on, NOT the c2c repo).
- Do not add `-w` to machine-wide commands: `update-check`, `sandbox-allow`,
  `prefs`, `tunnel login`. They still accept and ignore `-w`, so a leftover
  flag must not fail the command.

## Daily update check

At the START of every workflow below (before anything else), run these two
commands (local safety checks always run; network checks are cached):

1. `c2c update-check --json` (do not pass `-w`)
2. `c2c sandbox-allow --json` (do not pass `-w`) — writes the C2C state directory into Codex's
   sandbox `writable_roots` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/codex-with-chatgpt`;
   Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-with-chatgpt`; config file is
   `<codex-home>/config.toml`; see **Locations**).
   If already allowlisted, this is a no-op and does not trigger elevation.

- The checker uses this checkout's current branch and its configured upstream,
  never a remote's default branch. It checks dirty status before reading cache.
  Cache identity includes checkout, branch, upstream, HEAD, remote binding and
  the current upstream tracking commit; changing any of these invalidates it.
- `working_tree_dirty`, `local_ahead`, `diverged`, `no_upstream`, or `detached`
  → skip automatic update and continue the user's original task. Dirty/ahead
  may be skipped silently. Do not announce a new version or enter update.
  All other blocked, unavailable, or failed checks also skip update and continue.
- Only `updateAvailable: true`, `autoUpdateEligible: true`,
  `updateBlocked: false`, and `reason: "behind"` mean clean + behind-only.
  Revalidate through the update workflow below before announcing or updating.
- After that fresh preflight confirms eligibility, tell the user one line:
  "检测到 Codex with ChatGPT 有新版本，我先更新一下（约 1 分钟），随后继续你的任务。"
  Then run the update workflow below, and CONTINUE the original task afterwards.

## Workflow: update（"更新 Codex with ChatGPT"，or triggered by the daily check）

Inside the checkout directory (see Locations), for both automatic updates and
an explicit user request to update C2C:

1. Run a fresh `c2c update-check --force --json`. Require all of:
   `autoUpdateEligible: true`, `updateAvailable: true`, `updateBlocked: false`,
   `reason: "behind"`, a clean checkout, a non-detached branch with configured
   upstream, `ahead == 0`, `behind > 0`, and verified fast-forward ancestry.
   A daily cached positive result alone is never permission to pull.
   If any condition fails, skip update and continue the original task.
   For dirty state, at most once say:
   "Codex with ChatGPT checkout 有本地修改，自动更新已跳过。"
2. Immediately recheck `git status --porcelain` in this exact checkout and
   confirm branch, HEAD and configured upstream still match the fresh result,
   including `upstreamRemote`, `upstreamBranch`, `upstreamRef` and the SHA-256
   `remoteIdentity` of the configured fetch URL (the checker never prints that
   URL; for local upstream remote `.`, hash the canonical checkout path).
   A changed remote binding must skip update even when its name is unchanged.
   If they changed or status is nonempty, skip update and continue the task.
   Never stash, reset, clean, switch branches or overwrite local changes to
   enable an update, even when the user explicitly requested an update.
3. Only after those checks, `git pull --ff-only` from the current configured
   upstream. If pull fails, stop this update; do not attempt fallback commands.
   Preserve the checkout and continue the user's original task.
4. `corepack pnpm install && corepack pnpm build`. If either fails, report the
   failed update step; do not claim completion or discard local files.
5. Re-install the Skill: copy `skill/SKILL.md` to
   `<codex-home>/skills/codex-with-chatgpt/SKILL.md`, then fix the "checkout lives at:"
   line in the copy to the actual checkout path.
6. `c2c sandbox-allow --json`, then `c2c doctor -w <workspace> --json`.
   Respect the existing Doctor gate and controlled bridge runtime repair rules.
   Only a verified manageable Bridge may use `c2c restart -w <workspace>`;
   untrusted runtime requires the existing controlled recover workflow.
   Run doctor again after restart/recovery. Update itself never authorizes
   Connector deletion, pairing or Project instruction changes. Only a separate
   `chatgptRepair.needed` from the resulting doctor enters connector repair.
7. Refresh the update cache with `c2c update-check --force --json`.
   Tell the user "✓ 已更新到当前分支 upstream" only after build and connection
   verification succeed, then resume whatever task triggered this.
   (The updated SKILL.md takes effect from the next Codex session; that's expected.)

## Connection choice (once per workspace)

Ask this **before** the public address exists (`c2c setup` / first `doctor --fix`
that starts a tunnel). Do not mention tunnels, wrangler, DNS, or hostnames.
Speak only of 临时地址 / 固定域名 / 登录 Cloudflare.

1. `c2c tunnel status -w <workspace> --json`
2. If `needsChoice` is false: do not ask again.
3. If `needsChoice` is true: tell the user exactly `userPrompt` and wait.
   - 没有账号 / 没有域名 / 临时 / 不用 →
     `c2c tunnel choose -w <ws> --mode quick --json`
   - 有域名（例如 example.com）→ first tell them `loginPrompt`, then
     `c2c tunnel choose -w <ws> --mode named --zone <domain> --json`.
     This may open the user's own browser (the Cloudflare exception in
     Golden rule 5). Wait until the command finishes.
     If they said they have an account but gave no domain: ask once for the
     domain. If the command returns `need: "zone"`, ask once and retry.
     If `fallback` is true: tell them `userMessage` and continue on the
     temporary address. Do not retry named unless they ask.
4. Never put connection credentials in the project. The CLI stores them in
   the C2C state directory.

## Workflow: first-time setup（"使用 Codex with ChatGPT 完成首次配置"）

1. Detect prerequisites yourself: `node --version` (>= 20), and check `cloudflared`.
   - If cloudflared is missing on macOS run `brew install cloudflared`; on Windows use
     `winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared`. Do this yourself; don't ask.
2. If the c2c repo has no `node_modules`, run `pnpm install && pnpm build` in it.
3. Run `c2c sandbox-allow --json`, then **Connection choice**, then
   `c2c setup -w <workspace> --json`.
   `sandbox-allow` edits Codex `config.toml` only — it adds C2C's state directory
   to `[sandbox_workspace_write].writable_roots` so later chats can write logs
   without elevation. If the write is denied, request approval and retry once.
   → returns `{ mcpUrl, pairingCode, workspaceName, connectorName, ... }`.
   `connectorName` is this workspace's plugin title (legacy installs stay
   `Codex with ChatGPT`; additional workspaces get `Codex with ChatGPT · <name>`).
   Pairing codes expire in ~5 minutes. Do not mint one until the ChatGPT
   Authorize / pairing form is on screen: run `c2c pair --json` then type
   that code immediately. Doctor does not pre-mint a code.
4. `c2c prefs --json` (this machine, not this workspace).
   - If `setupMode` is null: tell the user exactly `setupChoicePrompt`. Wait
     for「1」or「2」. Then `c2c prefs set --setup-mode auto` or `--setup-mode manual`.
     Do not open ChatGPT settings and do not start automatic configuration
     until they answer. Do not default to auto.
   - If they later ask to switch: same `c2c prefs set --setup-mode` command.
     Do not re-ask on a later workspace or on reconnect.
   - `setupMode: "manual"`: skip step 5's automatic ChatGPT settings. Go to
     **Guided manual ChatGPT setup** (chosen). Opening line:
     `接下来用手动教学配置。一次只需要做一个操作。`
     Do not say 自动配置没有成功.
   - `setupMode: "auto"`: continue with step 5. Keep the two-failure fallback.
5. Open ChatGPT on the ONE iab tab (see **In-app browser**). Foreground +
   markHandoff immediately. Same tab, `goto` only:
   - 开发人员模式: skip `https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security` when
     `developerModeEnabled` is true. Otherwise open it, enable 开发人员模式
     ("Developer mode") if it is off, then `c2c prefs set --developer-mode`.
     Never record it as off. If creating the connector later says developer
     mode is required, open this page, enable it, save `--developer-mode`,
     and retry create — do not skip that recovery.
   - 已有该 `connectorName`: `https://chatgpt.com/plugins` — Delete it (never
     Reconnect). Then `goto` the 加插件 URL below.
   - 还没有 / 刚删掉: `https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins`
     Operate ONLY on `connectorName` from step 3:
      - If that exact name exists: Delete it, then create it again. Never
        Reconnect, never edit-in-place, never open the old Server URL.
      - If it does not exist: create one with that exact name.
      - Never rename, delete, or edit a connector that belongs to another workspace.
      - Description: `Securely connect ChatGPT to the current Codex workspace for planning and review.`
      - Server URL: the `mcpUrl` from step 3
      - Authentication: OAuth
     Fill the known form in one script when you can. Then Connect / Authorize.
     Only then run `c2c pair --json` and type that code. As soon as it shows
     Connected / authorized / pairing accepted, continue — do NOT wait for 8
     tools on this page.
6. Same tab: open the first C2C chat per **Conversation management**
   (Project collection for a new workspace; `https://chatgpt.com/` only
   in long-chat). Confirm Chat mode per **In-app browser** §7 (if it is Work,
   open a new Chat conversation instead). Send the boot prompt from
   `docs/protocol.md` §Boot Prompt, then (same chat) send:
   `Use the "<connectorName>" connector: call workspace_info and read hello-style top-level file. Reply with the workspace name.`
   Confirm the reply matches `workspaceName` (wait per **In-app browser** §8).
   Only then save the chat URL with `c2c session set` (see Conversation
   management). If the name does not match, do not save. markDeliverable.
7. Report to the user exactly in this shape (no internals):

```
Codex with ChatGPT

✓ 当前项目已识别
✓ Workspace Bridge 已启动
✓ 安全连接已建立
✓ ChatGPT 已连接
✓ 文件读取测试通过

Ready.
```

If a login wall appears (ChatGPT, Cloudflare): stop, tell the user the ONE thing
to do ("请登录 ChatGPT，完成后告诉我'好了'"), then continue.

### Guided manual ChatGPT setup

Enter this path when `setupMode` is `manual` (chosen at the start), or when
automatic ChatGPT browser configuration fails twice at the same explicit
setup/reconnect step after `c2c doctor` / repair. Do NOT enter the failure
path for a browser/js timeout without a visible error, a page that is
still loading/generating, or while waiting for login / 2FA / CAPTCHA.
A chosen manual path does not wait for those two failures.

Stop automating ChatGPT settings. Keep the current local C2C state and the
current `mcpUrl`, `pairingCode`, `workspaceName`, and `connectorName`. Do not
silently fall back to Codex-only execution and do not permanently disable C2C.
Do not change the saved `setupMode` when this is a failure fallback.

Opening line:

- Chosen (`setupMode: "manual"`): `接下来用手动教学配置。一次只需要做一个操作。`
- Failure fallback: `自动配置没有成功，我来带你手动完成。一次只需要做一个操作。`

Then guide ONE action at a time, waiting for the user to say「好了」before the
next action:

1. If `developerModeEnabled` is not true: ask them to open
   `https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security` and enable 开发人员模式. After they
   say「好了」, `c2c prefs set --developer-mode`. If it is already remembered,
   skip this step.
2. Ask them to open `https://chatgpt.com/plugins`. If the exact `connectorName`
   exists, delete only that connector. Never ask them to touch another workspace's connector.
3. Ask them to open
   `https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins`
   and create the exact `connectorName` with:
   - Description: `Securely connect ChatGPT to the current Codex workspace for planning and review.`
   - Server URL: the current `mcpUrl`
   - Authentication: OAuth
4. Ask them to Connect / Authorize. Then run `c2c pair --json` and give them
   only that pairing code. If it expires before they finish, run pair again.
5. When they report Connected / authorized / pairing accepted, resume the normal
   setup/reconnect flow at its ChatGPT verification step. If automatic browser
   verification then hits the same explicit failure twice, stop and report the
   exact failed step; do not loop indefinitely and do not continue without C2C.

## Conversation management

`c2c session -w <ws> --json` → `{ session, conversation }`.
`conversation.mode` is the only switch. Missing / legacy files with a chat URL
and no Project stay **long-chat**. Do not ask those users to migrate. If they
later say they want a Project, run **Bind Project**. A brand-new workspace
(no session file) is **project**.

Never match a Project or a chat by display name. Never upload the repo to
Project sources. Never click 分享 / Share. Do not rename ChatGPT chats.

### long-chat (do not rewrite this path)

ONE ChatGPT conversation per workspace. Same as before.

- **Find it**: if `conversation.reuseSavedChat` and `conversation.chatUrl`,
  `goto` that URL (foreground + markHandoff) and continue there.
- **Save it**: after boot + workspace_info, and the reply names this workspace,
  `c2c session set -w <ws> --mode long-chat --url <url> --title "C2C <workspace name>"`.
  If the name does not match, do not overwrite a previously saved URL.
- **Update it**: after each EXECUTED/DONE,
  `c2c session set -w <ws> --task <id> --iteration <n> --state <STATE>`
  plus checkpoint flags from the coding workflow (`--protocol-state`,
  `--waiting-for`, `--goal`, `--next-step`, `--known-issues`, or
  `--clear-checkpoint` on DONE). Do not put logs or diffs in those fields.
- **Switch it** ONLY when (a) the user asks for a new chat, (b) the current
  chat visibly lags, or (c) this conversation is Work. Then:
  1. Same iab tab: `goto` `https://chatgpt.com/`, confirm Chat mode
     (**In-app browser** §7), then send the boot prompt.
  2. Send a HANDOFF (`docs/protocol.md`) — goal, progress, state, issues,
     next step. Never paste files.
  3. workspace_info check; only then `c2c session set --url`. On failure,
     leave the old saved URL unchanged.
- Saved chat 404s: treat as a switch. Reconstruct HANDOFF from
  `session.checkpoint` (goal, progress, issues, next step). If there is no
  checkpoint, use `task` / `iteration` / `lastState` and `execution_summary`
  metadata only. Never paste logs or output bodies.

### project (new workspaces)

One ChatGPT Project per workspace. Mapping:

1. Same Codex conversation (this thread still has context) → same ChatGPT
   chat URL. `goto` that URL directly. Do not open the collection first.
2. Same workspace, a **new** Codex conversation → new ChatGPT chat from the
   collection page (`conversation.projectUrl`). Ignore `session.url` unless
   you already saved it earlier in THIS Codex thread.
3. Different workspace → different Project and different connector.

**Open a chat in this Codex thread**

- If the user explicitly asks to adopt / 接管 / use an existing chat as context
  and supplies a Project chat URL, follow **Adopt existing Project chat** first.
  A URL alone is not adopt intent. Do not use ordinary checkpoint recovery for
  that request; validation must complete before any session change or new INIT.
- If you already saved a ChatGPT chat URL earlier in THIS Codex conversation:
  `goto` that URL. Continue. No new chat. No HANDOFF.
- Else if `conversation.projectReady`: `goto` `conversation.projectUrl`.
  On that page, use the on-page composer (「{项目名}中的新聊天」 / "New chat
  in …"). Do not use the sidebar and do not `goto` `https://chatgpt.com/`.
  Confirm Chat mode (**In-app browser** §7). Boot prompt, then workspace_info
  with the **exact** `connectorName`. After the reply names this workspace,
  `c2c session set -w <ws> --mode project --project-url <collection> --url <chat> --connector-name "<connectorName>" --title "C2C <workspace name>"`.
  If this Codex thread is continuing a previous C2C task, send HANDOFF right
  after the boot prompt.
- Else: **Bind Project** first.

**Update it**: same `c2c session set --task / --iteration / --state` as long-chat.

**Wrong collection**: do not guess another Project. Tell the user the expected
workspace name, ask them to open the right collection, then say「已找到」.
Also offer「继续用长对话」. If they pick long-chat:
`c2c session set -w <ws> --mode long-chat` and use the long-chat path.
If the collection 404s or the new chat is not inside the Project, same choice.

**Saved chat 404s** (this thread): `goto` the collection, open a new chat
there, boot + HANDOFF from `session.checkpoint` (no logs) + workspace_info,
then save the new chat URL. Keep `--project-url`.

### Adopt existing Project chat (explicit context adoption only)

Enter ONLY when the user clearly asks to adopt / 接管 / 使用这个已有 Chat /
用这个会话作为上下文 and supplies one Project chat URL. Merely mentioning
any ChatGPT URL does not trigger adopt. If there are multiple candidates, ask
the user to select exactly one; do not guess or proceed with adoption.
An explicit adopt request with an invalid URL fails; do not silently fall
back to ordinary new-chat or checkpoint recovery behavior.

1. Run **Daily update check** (update-check and sandbox-allow), then the coding
   workflow's tunnel / Connection choice / doctor gate as usual. Do not open
   the candidate or send any new INIT until the gate is green. Defer task-id
   generation and checkpoint recovery while this adopt request is pending.
   If connector repair is needed, perform only reconnect's connector settings
   repair and follow-up doctor gate, then return here. Skip its ordinary saved
   chat recovery, HANDOFF, replacement-chat creation and session URL writes.
2. `c2c session -w <workspace> --json`. Require `conversation.mode === "project"`
   and `conversation.projectReady === true`, with a valid existing
   `session.projectUrl`. If unbound, reject adopt and use the existing
   **Bind Project** flow before retrying; never derive a new Project binding
   from the supplied chat URL. Do not switch long-chat mode through adopt.
3. Validate using the URL semantics in `src/session/state.ts`:
   - HTTPS, hostname exactly `chatgpt.com` or `www.chatgpt.com`; normalize to
     `https://chatgpt.com`. No credentials or non-default port.
   - Path exactly `/g/<project>/c/<chat>`, with nonempty opaque segments.
     Strip query, hash, and trailing `/`; retain segment spelling and case.
     Slugs and hyphens are valid. Reject `/c/<chat>`, a collection
     `/g/<project>/project`, extra path segments, and other hosts.
   - Compare the candidate's project route with the route from the bound
     collection URL by exact string equality. A mismatch fails before navigation.
4. Claim the current unique IAB ChatGPT tab, keep it foreground, and
   `markHandoff` at the start and end of the turn. Directly `goto` the validated
   candidate URL on that tab (skip goto if already there). No second ChatGPT
   tab and no Computer Use. Confirm the actual page remains the specified
   Project chat; a redirect to another chat or Project fails validation.
   Handle Retry-only using **In-app browser** §7 on the same tab, but return
   to this exact candidate for validation. Never adopt the recovery chat,
   create a replacement, or persist anything if the candidate remains unavailable.
5. Confirm Chat mode using **In-app browser** §7. If the actual conversation
   is Work, reject adopt; do not convert it, switch to a new chat, or modify
   the session. Do not send the boot prompt or INIT to a Work conversation.
6. In this candidate chat, call `workspace_info` through the Project's exact
   `session.connectorName`. If the connector name is missing, stop. Ask:
   `Use ONLY connector "<connectorName>" to call workspace_info and return
   workspaceName. This is a connection check, not continuation of an earlier
   task. Do not plan yet.` Wait per **In-app browser** §8, reading only the
   new verification reply. Require returned `workspaceName` to equal the
   current workspaceName. Failure, inability to verify, or a different
   workspace means stop; never substitute another connector.
7. ONLY after Project, Chat mode, and workspace verification all pass:
   `c2c session adopt -w <workspace> --url "<normalized candidate>" --json`.
   Require `ok: true`. This preserves project mode, projectUrl and connectorName;
   replaces url; clears title, taskId, iteration, lastState and checkpoint;
   updates savedAt. The CLI validates local URL/binding only; it does not
   perform browser or workspace_info checks. Re-read the returned session
   instead of using the pre-adopt snapshot or its checkpoint.
8. Bind this URL to THIS Codex conversation. If needed, send the existing
   `docs/protocol.md` Boot Prompt to establish the current protocol. Always
   generate a fresh `c2c_<random>` TASK_ID after successful adopt; do not
   reuse an old checkpoint id or iteration. Proceed to coding workflow step 2
   to send STATE INIT / ITERATION 0 exactly once using the adopted INIT
   template in `docs/protocol.md`, then perform its visibility/checkpoint
   checks and continue with steps 3 onward.

Adopt takes only conversation context. Never scan historical `[C2C]` messages
or read chat DOM to extract old TASK_ID, ITERATION, PLAN, EXECUTED, DONE or
BLOCKED, infer protocol state, or decide whether a previous task finished.
Earlier C2C, Codex, Antigravity and other coding-agent collaboration is
natural conversation context for ChatGPT only. Do not send HANDOFF for that
history, do not resume it, and do not add `STATE: RESUME` or mode `adopt`.
After the new INIT, process only replies for the new active TASK_ID.

On any adopt verification failure: keep the original session URL and checkpoint,
do not run session adopt/set/clear, do not send a new INIT, and explain the
specific reason clearly. A later NEW Codex conversation still creates a new
chat from the bound collection: project `reuseSavedChat` stays false, and a
saved adopted URL alone never authorizes reuse in another thread.

### Bind Project (user creates the collection once)

Do this for a new workspace, or when an existing user asks to switch to
Project. Do **not** click the ChatGPT sidebar to create the Project
(Computer Use is forbidden; IAB must not hunt that menu).

1. Tell the user exactly this (fill in the workspace name):

```
请在 ChatGPT 里新建一个项目，名字用「<workspaceName>」，记忆请选「仅限项目记忆」。

如果侧栏里看不到「项目」：把鼠标放在「聊天」上，点右边出现的三个点，选择「按项目整理」。

建好后会打开合集页面。看到页面后跟我说「好了」。
```

2. Wait for「好了」/ the collection page. Same iab tab: read the address bar.
   It must look like `https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-…/project`. If it does not,
   ask them to open that project until it does. Then:
   `c2c session set -w <ws> --mode project --project-url <url> --connector-name "<connectorName>"`.

3. On that same collection page only, open 右上角 **… → 项目设置**.
   Do not click 分享. Do not add 来源 / files.
   - 记忆: 仅限项目记忆 (project-only). Leave 库访问权限 disabled.
   - 指令: paste **Project instructions** below (fill `{{…}}` from
     `workspace_info` / setup). Use the exact `connectorName` from setup.
     Never write the public / temporary address into 指令.
   Save and close settings.

4. Still on the collection page, create the first chat with the on-page
   composer, then boot + workspace_info as in setup step 5. Save the chat URL.

### Project instructions (paste into 项目设置 → 指令)

```
You are the planning and review layer for one local workspace. Codex executes.

This Project is bound only to:
- Workspace name: {{workspace_name}}
- Kind: {{project_type}} ({{languages}} / {{frameworks}})
- Connector (use this one only): {{connector_name}}

When you call tools, use ONLY that connector. Do not use any other
Codex with ChatGPT connector. If workspace_info names a different
workspace, stop. Do not plan. Do not use this Project's memory.

Read code, git, diffs, and any released command output through that
connector. Never ask anyone to paste file bodies, diffs, or logs. After
EXECUTED, call execution_output (list, then read) when a readable item
exists; if status is restricted, review from git instead. Never upload
the repo into this Project's files or sources.

When facts conflict, trust this order:
1. Current code from the connector
2. A HANDOFF in this chat (this task's goal, progress, next step)
3. These instructions
4. This Project's memory (durable architecture only; stale memory loses)

This Project's memory is only for this workspace. On HANDOFF, trust the
brief, re-read code through the connector, and resume at NEXT_EXPECTED_STEP.

Be substantive: why, which file, what to test. No empty one-liners and
no 40-step epics. Use C2C control messages.
```

## Workflow: coding task（"使用 Codex with ChatGPT 完成 XXX"）

Protocol states sent to ChatGPT: INIT → PLAN → EXECUTING → EXECUTED → REVIEW → (PLAN | DONE | BLOCKED).
Local checkpoint states (session only, never a ChatGPT `STATE:` line):
`INIT`, `PLAN_RECEIVED`, `EXECUTING`, `EXECUTED_LOCAL`, `EXECUTED_SENT`, `DONE`, `BLOCKED`.
Do not invent `STATE: RESUME`. If the original chat is gone, send HANDOFF.
All control messages start with `[C2C]`. Keep Codex→ChatGPT messages under 1 KB.
ChatGPT's replies are expected to be substantive (see step 3). Docs: `docs/protocol.md`.

### Local Bridge and execution-store command context

Commands that must observe or write the host's active Bridge/runtime/execution
store (`c2c status`, read-only `c2c doctor --no-fix`, `c2c record`, and
`c2c record-check`) must use the host execution tool with
`sandbox_permissions: require_escalated` from their first invocation whenever
that capability is available. Use it proactively; do not wait for a sandbox
error. This requests host access through the platform's approval path; it does
not bypass approval and does not mean launching PowerShell with Windows
administrator elevation.

If elevated execution is unavailable or denied, stop before writing a record
or claiming host state is verified. Ask the user to run the exact command in
their host shell and provide its result. Do not silently fall back to sandbox
output as authoritative. If elevated results disagree with the user's host
output, preserve both results and stop for diagnosis; do not retry `record`,
restart the Bridge, or infer success from a success message alone. This rule
does not authorize Bridge recovery, restart, tunnel, pairing, or Connector
changes; those still require the existing workflow's authorization.

0. `c2c tunnel status -w <workspace> --json`. If `needsChoice`, follow
   **Connection choice** first (existing installs: ask once, then remember).
   Then `c2c doctor -w <workspace> --json` (auto-repairs). **Doctor gate:** if local
   is not green, do not open ChatGPT and do not send INIT. If
   `namedRepair.needed` is true, tell the user `namedRepair.userMessage` and
   follow that specific diagnosis, then doctor again. Running an existing UUID
   Tunnel does not need `cert.pem`. Use `c2c tunnel login --json` (their browser;
   Cloudflare exception) only when an explicit management operation needs a
   missing account certificate; JSON faults require the indicated repair.
   If `chatgptRepair.needed` is true, tell the user `chatgptRepair.userMessage`
   (one paragraph, no internals), run **Workflow: reconnect after address
   reclaim**, then doctor again and only continue when the gate is green.
   For explicit adopt intent, defer task-id generation and checkpoint recovery
   to **Adopt existing Project chat**. Otherwise generate task id: `c2c_` +
   4 random hex chars — unless a checkpoint already has one (reuse that id;
   do not mint a second task).
1. `c2c session -w <workspace> --json`. Open ChatGPT on the same iab tab
   per **Conversation management** for `conversation.mode` (foreground +
   markHandoff). Explicit adopt intent: run **Adopt existing Project chat**
   before ordinary routing or checkpoint recovery, even when a checkpoint
   exists. On success jump to step 2 with a new task id and cleared session;
   on failure stop without INIT. long-chat: saved chat, or `https://chatgpt.com/` if none.
   project: this thread's chat URL, or the collection page for a new chat,
   or **Bind Project** if `projectReady` is false. On a NEW conversation
   confirm Chat mode (**In-app browser** §7), then send the boot prompt from
   `docs/protocol.md` §Boot Prompt and the workspace_info check (name the
   exact `connectorName`). Confirm the reply names the current workspace
   before saving the session URL. Do not use the browser to re-read code MCP
   already provides. After sending a control message, wait per
   **In-app browser** §8.

   **Ordinary routing only: resume from `session.checkpoint` before any INIT.**
   Successful explicit adopt skips this recovery and uses only its cleared
   returned session. Missing checkpoint
   (legacy session): continue as a normal new/continued loop. A browser/js
   timeout is not a lost task — claim the original tab; do not INIT, re-run,
   or resend EXECUTED just because a wait timed out.
   - `EXECUTED_SENT` + `waitingFor=GPT_REVIEW`: do not INIT, do not re-run,
     do not resend EXECUTED. Stay on the saved chat and wait for review. If
     that chat 404s: HANDOFF from checkpoint fields (no logs), then wait.
   - `EXECUTED_LOCAL`: local work is done; before sending EXECUTED, write the
     record through `c2c record -w <workspace-root> ...` and verify the exact
     TASK_ID + ITERATION with `c2c record-check -w <workspace-root> --task
     <id> --iteration <n> --json`. The check must be confirmed by the healthy
     Bridge that serves MCP and use its execution store. A CLI-only local record
     is insufficient. If the Bridge is unavailable, stores differ without an
     active Bridge-store binding, or the Bridge does not confirm the exact
     record, keep `EXECUTED_LOCAL`; do not re-run completed work or send
     EXECUTED until Bridge-visible verification succeeds.
   - `EXECUTING`: not finished. Continue the current PLAN if you still have
     it; otherwise HANDOFF and ask ChatGPT to restate the last PLAN. Do not
     treat it as done and do not INIT a new task.
   - `PLAN_RECEIVED`: execute that plan. Do not INIT.
   - `INIT` / `waitingFor=GPT_PLAN`: claim the tab and wait. Do not resend INIT.
   - `DONE`: summarize to the user if needed; `c2c session set --clear-checkpoint`.
   - `BLOCKED`: surface ChatGPT's reason; do not INIT.
   Never re-pair, never recreate the connector, and never rewrite Project
   instructions just to resume.
2. Send INIT with the user's goal (skip when the checkpoint says not to).
   After explicit adopt use `docs/protocol.md` §Adopted Project chat INIT
   with its CONTEXT notice and fresh TASK_ID; otherwise use this template:

```
[C2C]
STATE: INIT
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 0

GOAL:
<user's goal, one paragraph>

INSTRUCTION:
Inspect the connected workspace through the Codex with ChatGPT MCP connector.
Produce a C2C PLAN message.
```

   Confirm the INIT message is visibly in that ChatGPT conversation (one cheap
   DOM check). If the page is Retry-only, recover per **In-app browser** §7
   first. Do not write the waiting checkpoint, and do not wait for PLAN, until
   that message is visible.
   Then:
   `c2c session set -w <ws> --task <id> --iteration 0 --state INIT --protocol-state INIT --waiting-for GPT_PLAN --goal "<short goal>" --next-step "wait for PLAN"`
3. Wait for ChatGPT's `STATE: PLAN` reply (**In-app browser** §8 — short DOM
   checks, same tab; do not treat a 5-minute browser timeout as failure).
   Read GOAL/ACTIONS/TESTS/SUCCESS_CRITERIA.
   A good PLAN also carries RATIONALE and concrete natural-language edit
   suggestions (which file, what to change, why). If the reply is a bare
   one-liner with no rationale or file-level guidance, ask once:
   "Please expand the plan with rationale and concrete per-file suggestions."
   Then:
   `c2c session set -w <ws> --protocol-state PLAN_RECEIVED --waiting-for none --next-step "execute PLAN"`
4. Execute the plan yourself with your own harness (your tools, your judgment;
   ChatGPT does not micro-manage tool calls).
   Before you start:
   `c2c session set -w <ws> --protocol-state EXECUTING --waiting-for none --next-step "finish PLAN then record"`
5. Record the execution in the active Bridge's formal store so ChatGPT can read
   it via MCP. `c2c record` uses the Bridge admin capability and stores any
   associated command output in that same Bridge store. Metadata always:
   `c2c record -w <ws> --task c2c_f81a --iteration 1 --changed-files "src/a.ts,src/b.ts" --tests "27 passed" --exit-status ok`
   If this iteration ran a **test / build / lint / typecheck** command, also
   pass that command's output. Write stdout/stderr to a local temp file first,
   then:
   `c2c record … --command "pnpm test" --output-file <temp> --exit-code <n>`
   Record both success and failure. Do not record shell history, `.env`,
   keys, or unrelated dumps. Never paste that file (or any log) into ChatGPT.
   A success message from `c2c record` alone does not prove the record landed
   in the active Bridge store. Immediately verify the exact task and iteration
   in the same elevated host context:
   `c2c record-check -w <ws> --task <id> --iteration 1 --json`
   The command must exit 0 and return `ok: true` for the same task and
   iteration after the Bridge-side exact record check and state-store
   fingerprint check. A CLI-local record alone is not sufficient. If it fails
   or the pair does not match, keep the checkpoint at `EXECUTED_LOCAL`, repair
   the record through `c2c record`, and verify again; do not send
   STATE: EXECUTED yet. Only after that verification:
   `c2c session set -w <ws> --iteration 1 --state EXECUTED --protocol-state EXECUTED_LOCAL --waiting-for none --next-step "send EXECUTED"`
6. Send EXECUTED (no diffs, no logs). Tell ChatGPT to independently verify the
   exact TASK_ID + ITERATION through MCP `execution_summary` or `test_status`;
   request `execution_output` too when a readable item exists:

```
[C2C]
STATE: EXECUTED
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 1

RESULT:
Execution finished.

CHANGED_FILES:
4

TESTS:
27 passed

Please independently inspect the workspace and current git diff through MCP.
If execution_output lists a readable item for this iteration, list then read it.
If status is restricted, ignore it and review from git_diff.
```

   Then:
   `c2c session set -w <ws> --protocol-state EXECUTED_SENT --waiting-for GPT_REVIEW --next-step "wait for PLAN or DONE"`
7. ChatGPT reviews via MCP (`git_diff`, `read_file`, `execution_summary`,
   `test_status`, `execution_output`) and replies DONE / PLAN (next iteration)
   / BLOCKED. Bridge-side `record-check` proves the active Bridge store contains
   the record; it does not prove ChatGPT MCP can read it. Do not treat the
   execution-record chain as end-to-end verified until ChatGPT's own MCP read
   confirms the exact TASK_ID + ITERATION. If it cannot find the record, stop
   and diagnose the connector/session/route; do not append duplicate records to
   mask the visibility failure.
8. Loop. Respect maxIterations (`.c2c.json`, default 12). At the limit, pause and ask
   the user: "已完成 12 轮协作，仍有未解决问题，是否继续？"
9. On DONE: summarize the result to the user in plain language.
   `c2c session set -w <ws> --state DONE --clear-checkpoint`
10. On BLOCKED: read ChatGPT's reason, fix what you can, or surface the single
    decision the user must make.
    `c2c session set -w <ws> --protocol-state BLOCKED --waiting-for USER --known-issues "<short reason>"`

## Workflow: ChatGPT-generated media

The connector remains read-only. It can view supported PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/SVG
files with `read_image`, but it cannot write into the repository or retrieve a
browser download by itself.

When the user asks ChatGPT web to generate an image or video:

1. Generate it in the workspace's saved ChatGPT conversation using the same
   built-in browser tab and connector rules above.
2. Activate the finished asset's actual Download control through the visible
   ChatGPT UI. Browser screenshots are navigation evidence only; never save,
   crop, rename, or import a screenshot as the requested asset.
3. Import the original download through the local execution harness:
   `c2c asset import -w <ws> --from <downloaded-file> --to <new-workspace-relative-path> --json`.
4. The destination must be new and project-relative. The importer validates
   PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/SVG/MP4/MOV/WebM content, rejects active SVG and path
   escapes, and never overwrites an existing file. Include the imported path in
   EXECUTED/review.

## Workflow: disconnect（"断开 ChatGPT"）

1. `c2c unpair -w <workspace>` (revokes all tokens immediately).
2. Optionally remove the connector on the same iab tab via
   `https://chatgpt.com/plugins` (foreground + markHandoff). Only touch
   this workspace's `connectorName`.
3. Tell the user: "已断开 ChatGPT 对该项目的访问。"

## Workflow: reconnect after address reclaim（全关掉以后地址失效）

This is the normal case when the user quit Codex / the terminal / the machine:
the previous public address is gone. Doctor already started a new one.
`connectorAction: "update"` means Delete + create again — not Reconnect.

`c2c doctor --json` will look like:
`{ "chatgptRepair": { "needed": true, "connectorAction": "update", "connectorName": "...", "userMessage": "...", "mcpUrl": "...", "pages": { ... } } }`

1. Tell the user exactly `chatgptRepair.userMessage`. Then you repair. Do not
   ask them to click around ChatGPT unless a login wall appears. Do not open
   the C2C chat and do not send `[C2C]` until this repair finishes and a
   follow-up doctor is green. Never "try a message first to see if it works".
   Reuse `c2c prefs --json`. Do not re-ask setup mode. If `setupMode` is
   `manual`, use **Guided manual ChatGPT setup** (chosen) instead of automating.
2. Same one iab tab as setup (foreground + markHandoff). Settings URLs only
   until Connected — never hunt menus:
   - 开发人员模式: skip `https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security` when
     `developerModeEnabled` is true. If create/delete then says developer
     mode is required, open it, enable, `c2c prefs set --developer-mode`.
   - 插件总管（只用来 Delete）: `https://chatgpt.com/plugins`
   - 加插件（Delete 之后必走）: `https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins`
3. Operate ONLY on `chatgptRepair.connectorName`. Never touch another
   workspace's connector.
   - If that exact name exists on the plugins hub: **Delete** it. Confirm the
     delete if ChatGPT asks. **Never click Reconnect, Refresh, Connect, or
     Edit** on the old card — the old Server URL is dead and the page will
     hang on "This site cannot be reached".
   - Then `goto` the 加插件 URL and create that **same** `connectorName`
     (do not invent a second name):
      - Description: `Securely connect ChatGPT to the current Codex workspace for planning and review.`
      - Server URL: `chatgptRepair.mcpUrl`
      - Authentication: OAuth
     Then Connect / Authorize. Only then run `c2c pair --json` and type that
     code. Continue as soon as it is Connected — do not wait for 8 tools on
     the settings page.
   - If the name is already gone, skip Delete and only create.
4. `c2c doctor --json` again. Only after the Doctor gate is green:
   - If an explicit adopt request is pending, return directly to
     **Adopt existing Project chat** step 2 and validate that candidate with
     the repaired exact connector. Skip the ordinary saved-chat checks and
     step 5 below. Do not send HANDOFF, create a substitute chat, or write
     session URL/checkpoint before adopt validation succeeds.
   - Otherwise continue the ordinary reconnect path on the same tab:
   reopen the chat this Codex thread was already using (`session.url` /
   the URL you saved earlier in THIS thread). Do not rewrite Project
   instructions — they store the connector **name**, which did not change.
   In that same chat, send the workspace_info check from setup step 6
   (exact `connectorName`). Doctor green is not enough: the old conversation
   may still be bound to the deleted connector.
   - If the reply names this workspace: continue there. Save the URL if needed.
   - If workspace_info fails, times out, or cannot read the name: do **not**
     keep retrying that old URL. project → collection page, new chat in this
     Project, boot + HANDOFF from `session.checkpoint` (no logs) +
     workspace_info, then `c2c session set --url` only after the name matches.
     long-chat → Conversation management switch, same checks. Keep the old
     saved URL until the new chat passes.
5. If the ChatGPT conversation was lost: same as the failure path in step 4.
   No file re-uploading (the workspace lives in MCP). If tools point at
   the wrong connector, open 项目设置 and confirm 指令 still names
   `connectorName` (never paste the new public address).

## Workflow: repair（anything looks broken）

1. `c2c doctor -w <workspace> --json`. Doctor gate: do not open ChatGPT / send
   `[C2C]` until local is green, except reconnect settings pages.
   After ANY doctor call, if `bridgeRepair.needed` is true, follow
   **Workflow: bridge runtime repair** and stop this ordinary recovery path.
2. If `namedRepair.needed`, tell the user `namedRepair.userMessage` and follow
   the specific run credential or connectivity diagnosis, then doctor again.
   Absence of `cert.pem` alone does not block an existing UUID Tunnel. Only an
   explicit management operation needing a missing account certificate calls
   for `c2c tunnel login --json`. Do not Delete the connector.
3. If `chatgptRepair.needed`, follow **reconnect after address reclaim**, then
   doctor again.
4. Otherwise apply the recovery map. Only involve the user for login / 2FA /
   CAPTCHA — one action.

## Workflow: bridge runtime repair (untrusted live instance)

Use when doctor returns `bridgeRepair.needed: true` with `reason: stale_runtime`
or `admin_unavailable`. A matching workspace health response alone does not
prove the saved instance/admin capability is valid. Legacy runtime or health
without instanceId is deliberately unverified, even when its PID is alive.

1. `automatic: false` means ordinary doctor does not perform maintenance.
   When the user explicitly asks/allows recovery, OR this is connection recovery
   inside the normal C2C workflow, use the controlled command:
   - Current working directory is the canonical target workspace:
     `c2c bridge recover --json`.
   - Working directory differs from the target workspace:
     `c2c bridge recover -w "<workspace>" --json`.
   A read-only diagnostic request uses `--dry-run` instead; it does not authorize
   execution of the termination plan. With no recovery intent/workflow, tell
   the user `bridgeRepair.userMessage` and wait for that decision.
2. Trust the command's strict verification outcome. It checks actual C2C serve
   argv, canonical workspace, process creation identity and descendants before
   retiring anything. Never bypass a blocked plan, add --force, kill a PID by
   hand, clear runtime, copy health instanceId/adminToken into it, or start a
   second Bridge. On `ok: false` / unsafe process identification, explain the
   returned blocker and say manual maintenance is needed; stop automated
   recovery. Do not retry in a restart loop or resume from another chat.
   `dryRun: true` is a plan, not a completed recovery: report it and stop this
   workflow even when `ok: true`. Do not turn it into real recovery or default
   doctor automatically. Any diagnostic follow-up uses `doctor --no-fix` only.
3. Success: run doctor again (omit `-w` when cwd is already this workspace).
   Only a green doctor gate allows ChatGPT navigation or the original task
   to continue. Recovery preserves auth, session, checkpoint, Project binding
   and named tunnel state. A configured Named Tunnel reuses its existing name
   and hostname: unchanged hostname means no Delete/Recreate connector,
   no re-pair and no Project instruction changes. Do not provision or log in
   merely for stale runtime. Follow existing named repair only if doctor
   separately reports `namedRepair.needed`.
4. Quick Tunnel may get a new URL. Respect recovery's `connectorRepairNeeded`
   / `chatgptRepair` and the follow-up doctor report; address changes require
   the existing reconnect flow only after local verification succeeds. Never
   operate ChatGPT UI from the recover command, or recreate a connector just
   because the old runtime was stale. If a new Bridge started but final
   verification failed, preserve that reported state and stop; do not cycle
   it again. Keep the original C2C task/checkpoint until the gate is green.

## Recovery map

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Bridge not running | `c2c start` (doctor does this automatically) |
| `bridgeRepair.needed` / `stale_runtime` / `admin_unavailable` | Follow controlled bridge runtime repair: `c2c bridge recover --json` in the target cwd (otherwise pass `-w`). Refuse unsafe identification; no force, manual PID kill, re-pair or connector recreation. |
| Tunnel dead / URL unreachable / 全关掉后连接失效 | `c2c doctor` → if `namedRepair.needed`, follow `namedRepair.userMessage` for the specific credential repair and doctor again (do not Delete). If `chatgptRepair.needed`, tell the user the message, then **Delete** THIS workspace's connector only (`connectorName`) and create it again. Never Reconnect. After recreate, re-check `workspace_info` in the saved chat; if it still fails, new chat in the same Project (or long-chat switch) + HANDOFF. |
| Collection page shows only Retry | Same iab tab: Retry once, then open the last working chat and click its Project link. Do not write INIT/EXECUTED waiting checkpoints until the message is visible. |
| ChatGPT says tool call failed / 401 | token expired or revoked → re-pair (new pairing code + authorize) |
| Pairing code rejected/expired | `c2c pair --json` for a fresh code |
| Same explicit ChatGPT setup/reconnect browser configuration step fails twice after repair | Stop automating ChatGPT settings and use **Guided manual ChatGPT setup fallback**. Do not count browser/js timeout, loading/generating, or login/2FA waiting as failures. |
| Port conflict | handled automatically; never surface to the user |
| Every new chat “repairs” / cannot write the log or settings directory | `c2c sandbox-allow --json` (once). Do not ask the user. |
| cloudflared missing | install it yourself (brew/winget), then retry |
| Sidebar has no「项目」 | Ask the user to hover「聊天」, click the …, choose「按项目整理」 |
| Collection page is the wrong Project | Ask the user to open the named collection and say「已找到」, or accept long-chat |
